## Installation

The `devtools` library for R allows package installation from GitHub

``` r
devtools::install_github("robertwwalker/ResampleProps")
```

# Examples

There are four commands of similar structure: ResampleMean, ResampleProp, ResampleDiffMeans, ResampleDiffProps.  I will show an example of a single mean.  The proportions calculations rely on binary data transformed to a table.  There is an option `tab.col` that allows one to select which column of the proportions table is of interest.  This simply owes to R's alphabetizing factors.

## A Single Mean

Resampling a single mean 1000 times is easy.

```{r ex2}
library(ResampleProps)
My.LNorm.Means <- ResampleMean(rlnorm(100))
summary(My.LNorm.Means)
```
### Plot of the Resampled Means

```{r}
plot(density(My.LNorm.Means), main="1000 LogNormal Means")
```

## A Single Proportion

Resampling a single proportion 1000 times is easy.

```{r example}
My.Props <- ResampleProp(rbinom(100, size=1, prob = 0.4))
summary(My.Props)
```
### Plot of the Resampled Proportions

```{r}
plot(density(My.LNorm.Means), main="1000 LogNormal Means")
```
